# Storm - Simulated Trajectory Of Rocket Mechanics

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 1.7.0.


## About

In STORM we take parameters of rocket from user (mass of rocket,thrust of stages etc) & depending on the parameters we calculate velocity accelaration and all the required values to fly a rocket and display how the rocket will take off 

Right now storm is completely for educational purpose and for those people who want to learn how rockets fly or for someone who want to test his physics knowledge and experiment by putting different values

This project is still in development mode and there are lot of things we are looking forward to add

## How to Run

1. Clone / Download the directory
2. Open Command Prompt
3. Install [npm](https://nodejs.org/) and Angular Client `npm install @angular/cli` (ignore if already installed)
4. Type `npm install` to get required node modules
5. Type `ng serve`
6. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200` in your browser

## About Files

1. You can find angular components inside `/src/app/`
2. All the logical functions are inside `/src/app/services/`


## Code scaffolding

Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module`.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory. Use the `-prod` flag for a production build.

## Running unit tests

Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).

## Running end-to-end tests

Run `ng e2e` to execute the end-to-end tests via [Protractor](http://www.protractortest.org/).
